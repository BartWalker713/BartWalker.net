        Growing up in Greenbrier TN, about 20 miles north of downtown Nashville, Bart started cutting his teeth on bluegrass. First, on guitar and later picking up the mandolin, banjo, dobro, and whatever else happened to be laying around the house. Having a father that was a Marine and a Decon in the local Baptist Church along with a mother that was his 6th, 7th, and 8th grade teacher, discipline at the forefront of his upbringing and was a very helpful trait to learn at a young age. As the musical interest grew, so did the love for all genres. Bluegrass and Blues were the biggest catalysts for his musical growth but, Funk, R&B, Americana, Rap, Rock'n'Roll, Metal, and Country were all important to the eclectic growth. The first paying gig was at the Station Inn in Nashville with Randall Hylton, Kenny Baker and Josh Graves. The house gig at B.B. King's Blues Club was where the dues were paid before really hitting the road and beginning his touring career, both as a solo artist and sideman. Though Bart spends plenty of time on the road with The Desert City Ramblers, T. Graham Brown, and Hank Williams Jr, he also enjoys recording, writing, and teaching music.
